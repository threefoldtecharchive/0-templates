# Template to deploy 0-db


# Node robot level:
A 0-db process needs to be automatically started by the node robot on top of each disk when the node boots.
The process needs to be started using the `--admin <secret>` flag so the 0-db is started with an admin account protected by `<secret>`. The secret needs to be generated by the 0-robot, which makes the robot the admin and the only one to be able to manage namespace.
